## Installation & updating

```shell
git rebase upstream/main

docker run --rm \
  -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -v "$(pwd):/var/www/html" \
  -w /var/www/html \
  laravelsail/php83-composer:latest \
  composer install --ignore-platform-reqs

And then ask an AI: 
`Hey, I want you to compare the old 2024 mailcoach migrations to the new ones, and then I want you to delete the new ones, and implement the difference in new migrations, this way I can "update" my old migrations to the new ones. Were using Laravel Sail`
```
